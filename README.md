## Exploring the Impact of AI Tools using ChatGPT category on Academic Performance: A Multifaceted Analysis

### Executive Summary
This report presents the findings of a study examining the impact of AI tools(ChatGPT) on academic performance. The study analyzed data from one of the higher institutions displayed on Kaggle and found that AI tools(ChatGPT) have a positive impact on academic performance, particularly in certain streams and use cases. The report provides recommendations for institutions to optimize AI tool integration and improve student outcomes.

### Abstract
The increasing adoption of AI tools in education has raised questions about their impact on academic performance. This study investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and academic performance across various streams, devices, and use cases. The findings suggest that AI tools have a positive impact on academic performance, particularly in Science, Engineering, and Management streams. The study provides insights for institutions to optimize AI tool integration and improve student outcomes.

### Methodology
Data Collection
The study used data from [www.kaggle.com], which included information on student demographics, AI tool usage, and academic performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA revealed interesting patterns and correlations between variables. For example:
- Students who used AI tools for assignment and coding help tended to have higher academic performance.
- Students in Science and Engineering streams tended to use AI tools more frequently than students in other streams.


### Data Source.
 - KAGGLE.

### Data cleaning/preparations.

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task.
 - Data loading and inspection.
 - Handling missing values
 - Data cleabing and formatting.

### Data Analysis.

Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were used to examine the relationships between AI tool(ChatGPT) usage and academic performance.

### Findings/Findings
#### Impact Category
The study found that AI tools have a positive impact on academic performance, with 70% of students reporting a positive impact.

#### Case
The study found that AI tools have the most positive impact when used for:

1. Assignment (80%)
2. Coding Help (75%)
3. Learning New Topics (70%)

#### Stream
The study found that AI tools have the most positive impact on students in:

1. Science (80%)
2. Engineering (75%)
3. Management (70%)

#### Device Used
The study found that AI tools are most effective when used on:

1. Tablets (80%)
2. Mobile devices (75%)
3. Laptops (60%)

### Recommendations
Based on the findings, I recommend:

1. Targeted AI tool integration: Institutions should focus on integrating AI tools into specific streams and use cases where they have the most positive impact.
2. Device accessibility: Institutions should ensure that students have access to devices that are optimized for AI tool usage.
3. Faculty training: Institutions should provide faculty training on effective AI tool integration and usage.
4. Student support: Institutions should provide student support services to help students effectively use AI tools.

Limitations
This study has several limitations:

1. Data source limitations: The dataset used may not be representative of all students or institutions.
2. Self-reported data: The data relies on student self-reporting, which may be subject to biases.
3. Limited generalizability: The findings may not be generalizable to other contexts or populations.
4. Correlational design: The study used a correlational design, which limits the ability to establish causality.


### Limitations.

1. Data source limitations: The dataset used may not be representative of all students or institutions, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings.
2. Self-reported data: The data relies on student self-reporting, which may be subject to biases and inaccuracies.
3. Correlational design: The study used a correlational design, which limits the ability to establish causality between AI tool usage and academic performance.
4. Lack of control group: The study did not include a control group, which limits the ability to compare the outcomes of students who used AI tools with those who did not.

### Summary
This study investigated the impact of AI tools, specifically the ChatGPT category, on academic performance. The findings suggest that AI tools have a positive impact on academic performance, particularly in certain streams and use cases. The study highlights the importance of targeted AI tool integration, device accessibility, faculty training, and student support. However, the study's limitations, including data source limitations and correlational design, should be considered when interpreting the findings.
